### Question: What are the best features to predict heart disease?
The following models are trying to predict heart disease amongst people based on their biomedical data. That data includes information on the patient's age, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, their max heart rate, and oldpeak. What was found in the data is that the 3 features with greatest corelation, positive or negative, with heart diseae are age, max heart rate, and oldpeak.
